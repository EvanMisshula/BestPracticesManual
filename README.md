BestPracticesManual
===================

This is a manual of best practices in research transparency, by the Berkeley Institute for Transparency in the Social Sciences and the Center for Open Transparency

Version Notes:

1. Draft first uploaded by Garret Christensen on GitHub for collaborative editing 2014.11.6
Original Word doc formatted in Markdown using pandoc.

2. 2014.11.18 Changed to LaTeX because Markdown simply isn't designed for 50-page documents. The section headings alone were killing me. If we use github to sync the files offline, I think we/anyone should easily be able to compile the document.

3. 2014.12.11 Version presented at BITSS Annual Meeting
